              I personally believe that a good school should not only render
              academic services but also produce well-rounded students that can
              be engrafted into the society. Wellspring College has endeavored
              to instill godly values into my son and also emphasized the
              importance of sport as a means of exercise and recreation while
              giving him quality education.
